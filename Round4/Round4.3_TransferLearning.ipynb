    "Assume you want to build an app that distinguishes between different dog breeds. This can be modeled as a classification problem which we can solve using a deep neural network. Indeed, we could train a deep neural network to predict the dog breed based on a large set of labeled images. The problem is that the number of labeled images required for accurate training scales with the number of weights (and bias terms) of the deep net. It might well be that we do not have enough training images for some (rare) breeds.\n",

    "# Why Transfer Learning?\n",
    "Deep learning models are data-hungry - they need many training examples to learn the parameters of the network. This is one of the limiting aspects of deep neural networks and that is why transfer learning comes in handy. Transfer learning is a common and highly effective approach to train the model on a small image dataset by utilizing **pre-trained models**.  Furthermore, transfer learning helps to save training time, because the model is not trained from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-trained model** is a deep learning architecture that is trained over a large dataset. Such models are trained for thousands of hours for a given benchmark dataset and all the parameters in the networks are learned. There are numbers of such pre-trained models available and anyone can use them depending on the particular problem.\n",

    "# Key considerations for Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively apply transfer learning we need to answer three main questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **What to transfer**: While applying transfer learning we need to understand what knowledge is common between the source and target task. We try to seek answers on what knowledge is specific to the source task and what can be transferred from the source task to the target task that will help improve the performance of the target task. \n",
    "-  **When to transfer**: We should apply transfer learning only when source and target domain are related. When the source and target domains are not related at all, applying transfer learning degrades target task performance. This type of transfer is called Negative Transfer. \n",
    "- **How to transfer**: Once we have answers to what to transfer and when to transfer, we can proceed to identify the actual ways of transferring the knowledge across domains/tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**So, when does transfer learning makes sense?** \n",
    "\n",
    "If we are trying to learn from **Task A** and transfer knowledge to **Task B**, transfer learning is useful in the following scenario:\n",
    "- Task A and B have the same input x, e.g both have images as input. \n",
    "- There is a lot more data for Task A than Task B.\n",
    "- Low-level features from A could be helpful in learning task B."

    "# Transfer Learning Strategies\n",
    "There are two common ways to use pre-trained models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To use a pre-trained model as a feature extractor\n",
    "2. To fine-tune the pre-trained model \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-trained Models as a Feature Extractors\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in Round 3, a convolutional neural network consists of two parts: the first part is the series of convolutional and pooling layers, and the second part being densely connected layers. The first part is called **convolutional base** and the second - **classification head or classifier**. The main idea of using the pre-trained model as a feature extractor is to remove a fully connected layers (classification head) of the pre-trained model and use only a convolutional base to extract the features from new images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These extracted features will be used to train a new classifier for a new task. In this case, we do not retrain the pre-trained model or part of it (this is called **freezing** the network), but we only train the layers of the new classification head. In other words, the model will only have to learn the weights of the few new dense layers, that are on the top of the pre-trained model.\n",
    "The figure below demonstrates the concept of feature extraction from a pre-trained model and following training of a classifier on top of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a pre-trained model trained on source data like the ImageNet database (over 14 million images), we chop off the densely connected layers and use this convolutional base to extract the feature from target data (i.e data for new classification task). Specifically, this means to use the output of the convolutional base for training the new (target) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"../../../coursedata/R4/feature_extract.png\" alt=\"drawing\"/ align='middle'/>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Fine-tuning the pre-trained model \n",
    "In this case, we do not just replace and retrain the classifier head, i.e fully connected layers, but we also selectively re-train some of the top layers used for feature extraction in the pre-trained model. This process is called **fine-tuning** because it slightly adjusts the more abstract representations of the pre-trained model, in order to make them relevant for the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"../../../coursedata/R4/fine_tune.png\" alt=\"drawing\"/ align='middle'/>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deciding which transfer learning strategy to use \n",
    "Two different transfer learning strategies were presented above. But how do we decide which one to use? The decision is based on two factors: the size of the target (new) dataset (small or big), and its similarity to the source (original) dataset (e.g. ImageNet). Let's discuss four common scenarios and how to navigate among them when choosing a transfer learning strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. size of the target dataset is small and similar to the source dataset:** In this case, since the size of the new dataset is low, fine-tuning can lead to overfitting. As target data is similar to source data, we use the pre-trained model as a feature extractor while changing the output layer according to the new classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The size of the target dataset is small and dissimilar to source data:** In this case we fine-tune the last layers (including some layers of the convolutional block) while freezing the top layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. The size of the target dataset is large and similar to source data:** In such a scenario, the best option would be to fine-tune through the complete network of the pre-trained models with a small learning rate. Since the target dataset is large, there is less concern about overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. The size of the target dataset is large and dissimilar to source data:** Since the target dataset is large, we can train the neural network from scratch according to our data. However, in practice, it is very often still beneficial to initialize with weights from a pre-trained model.\n"

    "The first layers of the convolutional base encode more generic, reusable features like texture, corners, edges, and colour blobs, while layers higher up encode more specialized features like eye, nose, cloth item, etc. In order to improve the performance of the model even further, we can train (or **fine-tune**) the weights of the top layers of the pre-trained model alongside with training of the classifier we've added. This training process will force the weights to be tuned from generic feature maps to features associated specifically with the dataset we are using. However, we should be careful in choosing how many layers of the pre-trained model we want to fine-tune. The pre-trained model has millions of parameters, so the more parameters we are training, the more we are at risk of overfitting the training data, especially if our dataset is small.\n",

    "Another important thing to remember is that classifier we will be using during fine-tuning should be already trained. If we will add an untrained classifier on the top of the model and at the same time will unfreeze few layers of **conv_base**, the error propagating through the network will be too large and will destroy learned features of unfrozen layers. This is an unwanted outcome, as our aim is to fine-tune (make small changes) the weights of the convolutional base and not to learn them from the scratch.\n",

Thus, we do not randomly initialize the weight of our dense layers, rather the classifier inherits the weights learned from earlier training. Previously we trained the network for 5 epochs, therefore we will use weights learned at the end of the 5th epoch for our classifier. We will further train the model for more 10 epochs (variable `fine_tune_epochs`). Set `epochs`  to `total_epochs` variable, which is a sum of `initial_epochs` and `fine_tune_epochs` and equals in our case to 15 .\n",
